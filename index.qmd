# Inspirations and Influences {#sec-introduction}

What - if any - kind of book needs to be written about relational and contextual epidemiology? 

## Why relational and contextual epidemiology? 

There is a hole in the epidemiological literature that limits our ability to come to grips with the *relational* aspects of health and illness. For the purposes of this book, relationships are sources of non-independence. These could be *social* influences, e.g. from our friends and family. But they could also be *spatial* in nature, e.g. a result of some physically proximate environmental exposure. Often, the relationships we care about are *temporal* in nature, as is evident in the lifecourse perspective in which early-life exposures are understood to impact later-life outcomes.  

There are many good books and papers out there about these topics as well as some of their conjunctions with each other (e.g. spatiotemporal analysis). But there is less written about their overlaps and commonalities, why knowing one teaches you so much about the others, and what having access to this set of tools might mean for a working epidemiologist.

In many ways, my goal in writing this is selfish, to satisfy a personal curiosity I suspect is of some greater import to at least a few people. Specifically: What does it mean to do *contextual* or *relational* epidemiology? Are these meaningless terms that just appeal to the social and natural science centers of my brain, or does this tap into something more meaningful?

### More than methods

Part of my inspiration is a reaction to the technocratic impulse and imperative in modern epidemiology. In particular, I find myself a bit paralyzed by the worry about what happens when we operate under the assumption that escalating methodological complexity is an imperative and that the road out of socio-epidemiological problems is paved with technological solutions. 


### But also, methods...

On the other side, simply put, I love the methodological tools of spatial epidemiology, Bayesian hierarchical analysis, and systems modeling. I have learned more than I ever could have hoped through learning, tinkering with, and applying these tools to problems in the real world and in my own head. But for me, the large majority of lessons learned have been from their conceptual isomorphisms (or conflicts) with the world as it appears to us through qualitative and quantitative data, rather than in the exact values of their parameter values and quantitative predictions. 

For me, this book is about resolving this cognitive dissonance while providing useful 'how-to' pointers along the way. I hope to articulate the affirmative case for a systems-based, contextually-sensitive, justice-oriented, morally and ethically opinionated, and theoretically driven approach to epidemiology. Along the way, I hope to show why the tools of such an approach are necessarily heterogeneous in nature and require us to accept uncertaintities quantitative and epistemic. 


## Influences

There are any number of books and papers out there that have articulated a similar perspective on the tools of quantitative analysis. The following have been particularly important for my own thinking and their influences will be felt throughout this work:

- Statistical Rethinking [@mcelreath2020]

- The Ecological Detective [@hilborn1997]

- ARM/Regression and Other Stories [@gelman2020a]

What makes these works so useful, strong, and enduring is the way that they articulate a coherent, opinionated perspective on the meaning and use of a set of methodological tools. On top of that, they are engaging and fun to read - the sort of thing you return to over time not just to get specific methodological tools, but to be exposed to their perspective.
