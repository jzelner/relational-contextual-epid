  abstract = {Objective Most respiratory virus surveillance relies on medically attended respiratory illness, but an understanding of the true patterns of infection independent of care-seeking behaviour would enhance clinical and public health responses to respiratory virus outbreaks. We evaluated the potential of decedent surveillance by estimating the burden of respiratory virus infection in decedents in a large, urban medical examiner's office. Study design Observational. Methods In 2020\textendash 2022, we tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 4121 decedents in Detroit, Michigan for 15 respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus A and B. We analysed infection prevalence over time and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and manner of death. Results Of 4113 valid tests, 30.2\% were positive for at least one virus, and 6.1\% were positive for multiple viruses. All viruses were detected except for influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B. The most prevalent viruses were SARS-CoV-2 (15.7\%), rhinovirus (11.2\%), and adenovirus (4.9\%), which were detected in all months. Most viruses exhibited decreasing prevalence with age, higher prevalence among Black and Hispanic than among White decedents and lower prevalence among deaths from natural causes; SARS-CoV-2 was a notable exception to the patterns by age and manner of death, instead reflecting community trends in catchment counties. Conclusions There was high prevalence and diversity of respiratory viruses in decedents entering a large, urban medical examiner's office. Decedent surveillance could offer a clearer picture of the true underlying burden of infection, motivating public health priorities for intervention and vaccine development, and augmenting data for real-time response to respiratory virus outbreaks.},

  abstract = {The relative lack of attention to philosophy and theory in research on social inequalities in health and its consequences for explanation and methodology has been described in the social epidemiologic literature. Nevertheless, the field of social epidemiology, dominated as it is by the trappings of positivism, is arguably still in need of further development of epistemological frameworks that can adequately incorporate richer explanations of the phenomena we study. Some have advocated for the adoption of a critical realist perspective for the study of social inequalities in health in order to overcome some of the difficulties described above. This chapter uses critical realism as a means to identify some of the epistemological and methodological difficulties inherent in attempts to explain health inequalities (especially the connection between social and biological mechanisms) and offer an ``affirmative'' approach to health inequalities research based on the insights of \-critical realist philosophy. In both the physical and social sciences, concerns about epistemology and philosophy are routinely left unexamined. This chapter argues that a more explicit engagement with such questions is an important next step in social epidemiology and health inequalities research. The chapter begins with a description of the explanatory problem faced by research on social inequalities in health. This explanatory task is difficult, but it is precisely that difficulty which \-cannot be adequately accommodated by the unacknowledged epistemological underpinnings of social epidemiology. The chapter highlights several key features of the critical realist approach and demonstrates how these can be usefully applied to health inequalities research to solve persistent problems of explanation and \-methodological pluralism. Specifically, the chapter argues that the complexity of the social phenomena implicated in this research demands a more detailed consideration of what is meant by causation, ``explanation'' and ``theory,'' and of what the relationship of these concepts should be to empirical research.},

How do we make the field and laboratory coherent? How do we link models and data? How do we use statistics to help experimentation? How do we integrate modeling and statistics? How do we confront multiple hypotheses with data and assign degrees of belief to different hypotheses? How do we deal with time series (in which data are linked from one measurement to the next) or put multiple sources of data into one inferential framework? These are the kinds of questions asked and answered by The Ecological Detective. Ray Hilborn and Marc Mangel investigate ecological data much as a detective would investigate a crime scene by trying different hypotheses until a coherent picture emerges. The book is not a set of pat statistical procedures but rather an approach. The Ecological Detective makes liberal use of computer programming for the generation of hypotheses, exploration of data, and the comparison of different models. The authors' attitude is one of exploration, both statistical and graphical. The background required is minimal, so that students with an undergraduate course in statistics and ecology can profitably add this work to their tool-kit for solving ecological problems.},

Racial residential segregation was assessed using the Getis-Ord G\textsubscript{i}* statistic, a measure of SD between the neighborhood's racial composition (ie, percentage of black residents) and the surrounding area's racial composition. Segregation was categorized as high (G\textsubscript{i}* \&gt;1.96), medium (G\textsubscript{i}* 0-1.96), and low (G\textsubscript{i}* \&lt;0). Fixed-effects linear regression modeling was used to estimate the associations of within-person change in exposure to segregation and within-person change in blood pressure while tightly controlling for time-invariant confounders.

Systolic blood pressure increased by a mean of 0.16 (95\% CI, 0.06-0.26) mm Hg with each 1-SD increase in segregation score after adjusting for interactions of time with age, sex, and field center. Of the 1861 participants (81.6\%) who lived in high-segregation neighborhoods at baseline, reductions in exposure to segregation were associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure. Mean differences in systolic blood pressure were -1.33 (95\% CI, -2.26 to -0.40) mm Hg when comparing high-segregation with medium-segregation neighborhoods and -1.19 (95\% CI, -2.08 to -0.31) mm Hg when comparing high-segregation with low-segregation neighborhoods after adjustment for time and interactions of time with baseline age, sex, and field center.

Urbanization occurs in stages; each stage characterized by a distinct habitat that may be more or less susceptible to the establishment of disease vector populations and the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. We performed longitudinal entomological and epidemiological surveys in households along a 1900 \texttimes{} 125 m transect of Arequipa, Peru, a major city of nearly one million inhabitants, in which the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, by the insect vector Triatoma infestans, is an ongoing problem. The transect spans a cline of urban development from established communities to land invasions. We find that the vector is tracking the development of the city, and the parasite, in turn, is tracking the dispersal of the vector. New urbanizations are free of vector infestation for decades. T. cruzi transmission is very recent and concentrated in more established communities. The increase in land tenure security during the course of urbanization, if not accompanied by reasonable and enforceable zoning codes, initiates an influx of construction materials, people and animals that creates fertile conditions for epidemics of some vector-borne diseases.},

Urban historians have pointed out ways in which the Southern postbellum pattern was less benign, but studies relying on census data aggregated by administrative areas - and segregation measures based on this data - have not confirmed their observations. Methods: This study is based mainly on 100\% microdata from the 1880 census that has been mapped at the address level in Washington, D.C. This data makes it possible to examine in detail the unique spatial configuration of segregation that is found in this city, especially the pattern of housing in alleys. Results: While segregation appears to have been low, as reflected in data by wards and even by much smaller enumeration districts, analyses at a finer spatial scale reveal strongly patterned separation between blacks and whites at this early time. Contribution: This research provides much new information about segregation in a major Southern city at the end of the 19th century. It also demonstrates the importance of dealing explicitly with issues of both scale and spatial pattern in studies of segregation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social epidemiology investigates both individuals and their collectives. Although the limits that define the individual bodies are very apparent, the collective body's geographical or cultural limits (eg "neighbourhood") are more difficult to discern. Also, epidemiologists normally investigate causation as changes in group means. However, many variables of interest in epidemiology may cause a change in the variance of the distribution of the dependent variable. In spite of that, variance is normally considered a measure of uncertainty or a nuisance rather than a source of substantive information. This reasoning is also true in many multilevel investigations, whereas understanding the distribution of variance across levels should be fundamental. This means-centric reductionism is mostly concerned with risk factors and creates a paradoxical situation, as social medicine is not only interested in increasing the (mean) health of the population, but also in understanding and decreasing inappropriate health and health care inequalities (variance). METHODS: Critical essay and literature review. RESULTS: The present study promotes (a) the application of measures of variance and clustering to evaluate the boundaries one uses in defining collective levels of analysis (eg neighbourhoods), (b) the combined use of measures of variance and means-centric measures of association, and (c) the investigation of causes of health variation (variance-altering causation). CONCLUSIONS: Both measures of variance and means-centric measures of association need to be included when performing contextual analyses. The variance approach, a new aspect of contextual analysis that cannot be interpreted in means-centric terms, allows perspectives to be expanded.},

All rights reserved.Morbilliviruses cause major mortality in marine mammals, but the dynamics of transmission and persistence are ill understood compared to terrestrial counterparts such as measles; this is especially true for epidemics in cetaceans. However, the recent outbreak of dolphin morbillivirus in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean can provide new insights into the epidemiology and spatiotemporal spread of this pathogen. To deal with uncertainties surrounding the ecology of this system (only stranded animals were observed), we develop a statistical framework that can extract key information about the underlying transmission process given only sparse data. Our self-exciting Poisson process model suggests that individuals are infectious for at most 24 days and can transfer infection up to two latitude degrees (220 km) within this time. In addition, the effective reproduction number is generally below one, but reaches 2.6 during a period of heightened stranding numbers near Virginia Beach, Virginia, in summer 2013. Network analysis suggests local movements dominate spatial spread, with seasonal migration facilitating wider dissemination along the coast. Finally, a low virus transmission rate or high levels of pre-existing immunity can explain the lack of viral spread into the Gulf of Mexico. More generally, our approach illustrates novel methodologies for analysing very indirectly observed epidemics.},

In this paper, indoor radon data from a survey in Minnesota are analyzed to minimize the effect of finite sample size within counties, to determine the true county-to-county variation of indoor radon concentrations in the state, and to find the extent to which this variation is explained by the variation in surficial radium concentration among counties. The analysis uses hierarchical modeling, in which some parameters of interest (such as county geometric mean radon concentrations) are assumed to be drawn from a single population, for which the distributional parameters are estimated from the data. Extensions of this technique, known as random effects regression and mixed effects regression, are used to determine the relationship between predictive variables and indoor radon concentrations; the results are used to refine the predictions of each county's radon levels, resulting in a great decrease in uncertainty. The true county-to-county variation of geometric mean radon levels is found to be substantially less than the county-to-county variation of the observed geometric means, much of which is due to the small sample size in each county. The variation in the logarithm of surficial radium content is shown to explain approximately 80\% of the variation of the logarithm of geometric mean radon concentration among counties. The influences of housing and measurement factors, such as whether the monitored home has a basement and whether the measurement was made in a basement, are also discussed. The statistical method can be used to predict mean radon concentrations, or applied to other geographically distributed environmental parameters.},

  abstract = {In India, the country with the third largest Muslim population in the world, residential segregation along religious lines has long been of concern. Many go so far as to speak of the large-scale `ghettoization' of Muslims, a trend commonly attributed to the state's negligence towards this religious minority and prolonged histories of so-called `communal' violence between religious groups. Others emphasize long-standing pattern of residential clustering in enclaves and claim that these have always been voluntary. Both the ghetto and the enclave are usually considered highly segregated spaces, though. This paper complicates such views through an in-depth engagement with the seminal ethnographic volume Muslims in Indian Cities, edited by Laurent Gayer and Christophe Jaffrelot. Based on novel quantitative estimates of religious demography, I contrast and compare the same 11 cities studied in their book \textendash{} Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Aligarh, Bhopal, Hyderabad, Delhi, Cuttack, Kozhikode and Bangalore \textendash{} using statistical indices of segregation. This comparison with the ethnographic `gold standard' shows that the mere extent of segregation is an insufficient shortcut to the phenomenon of ghettoization: a ghetto actually need not be highly segregated and a `mixed area' can be surprisingly homogenous. Consequently, I argue that one should not only distinguish between voluntary and forced clustering but also consider the wider `mental maps' through which inhabitants experience, perceive and judge their city. Such mental maps specifically help to uncover historical trajectories, feelings of insecurity and the future expectations of people regarding their cities \textendash{} irrespective of quantitative degrees of segregation.},

  abstract = {It is predicted that the integration of climate-based early warning systems into existing action plans will facilitate the timely provision of interventions to diarrheal disease epidemics in resource-poor settings. Diarrhea remains a considerable public health problem in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam and we aimed to quantify variation in the impact of environmental conditions on diarrheal disease risk across the city. Using all inpatient diarrheal admissions data from three large hospitals within HCMC, we developed a mixed effects regression model to differentiate district-level variation in risk due to environmental conditions from the overarching seasonality of diarrheal disease hospitalization in HCMC. We identified considerable spatial heterogeneity in the risk of all-cause diarrhea across districts of HCMC with low elevation and differential responses to flooding, air temperature, and humidity driving further spatial heterogeneity in diarrheal disease risk. The incorporation of these results into predictive forecasting algorithms will provide a powerful resource to aid diarrheal disease prevention and control practices in HCMC and other similar settings.},

  abstract = {The comparative sociology of the structure, dynamics, and experience of urban relegation in the United States and the European Union during the past three decades reveals the emergence of a new regime of marginality. This regime generates forms of poverty that are neither residual, nor cyclical or transitional, but inscribed in the future of contemporary societies insofar as they are fed by the ongoing fragmentation of the wage labour relationship, the functional disconnection of dispossessed neighbourhoods from the national and global economies, and the reconfiguration of the welfare state in the polarizing city. Based on a methodical comparison between the black American ghetto and the French working-class banlieue at century's turn, this article spotlights three distinctive spatial properties of `advanced marginality' \textemdash{} territorial fixation and stigmatization, spatial alienation and the dissolution of `place', and the loss of a hinterland \textemdash{} and draws out their implications for the formation of the `precariat' in postindustrial societies.},

However, social relationships also reduce the incidence of chronic disease and potentially infectious diseases. Seldom are these opposing effects considered simultaneously. We have shown how and why diarrheal disease spreads more slowly to and in rural Ecuadorian villages that are more remote from the area's population center. Reduced contact with outside individuals partially accounts for remote villages' relatively lower prevalence of diarrheal disease. But equally or more important is the greater density of social ties between individuals in remote communities, which facilitates the spread of individual and collective practices that reduce the transmission of diarrheal disease.},

  abstract = {Background. We aimed to identify and determine the etiology of ``hotspots'' of concentrated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-tuberculosis) risk in Lima, Peru. Methods. From 2009 to 2012, we conducted a prospective cohort study among households of tuberculosis cases from 106 health center (HC) areas in Lima, Peru. All notified tuberculosis cases and their household contacts were followed for 1 year. Symptomatic individuals were screened by microscopy and culture; positive cultures were tested for drug susceptibility (DST) and genotyped by 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable-number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR). Results. 3286 individuals with culture-confirmed disease, DST, and 24-loci MIRU-VNTR were included in our analysis. Our analysis reveals: (1) heterogeneity in annual per-capita incidence of tuberculosis and MDR-tuberculosis by HC, with a rate of MDR-tuberculosis 89 times greater (95\% confidence interval [CI], 54,185) in the most-affected versus the least-affected HC; (2) high risk for MDR-tuberculosis in a region spanning several HCs (odds ratio = 3.19, 95\% CI, 2.33, 4.36); and (3) spatial aggregation of MDR-tuberculosis genotypes, suggesting localized transmission. Conclusions. These findings reveal that localized transmission is an important driver of the epidemic of MDRtuberculosis in Lima. Efforts to interrupt transmission may be most effective if targeted to this area of the city.},
